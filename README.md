# pyBib
pyBib is a very basic bibTeX reader (and eventually editor) for the iPad (using the Pythonista app)

To use this app, you must have the Pythonista app installed on your iPad. I recommend using StaSh (https://github.com/ywangd/stash) to pip install required packages (and use git).

A homepage icon can be created using the 'Shortcuts' app (formerly Workflow).
